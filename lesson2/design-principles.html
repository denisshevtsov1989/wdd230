          <p>The visual hierarchy on the site is the organization and design of information in such a way that the
            visitor
            can
            quickly understand the interface and distinguish the main from the secondary.</p>

          <h2>What is the Rule of Thirds?</h2>
          <img src="img/screenshot-2.jpg" alt="mobile-version">
          <p>The Rule of Thirds web design technique is used for creating pleasing aesthetics and balance in images. It
            basically says that placing items of interest on the “thirds” of an image is more pleasing to the eye than
            centering or more other symmetrical approaches. These thirds are created by dividing an image (or working
            space)
            nto nine equal parts, with two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines</p>
